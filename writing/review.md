## Project Assessment

### Summary Checklist

TODO: Please create a filled checkbox for each project development task that you completed:

- [] Reviewed one or more pull requests in the GitHub repository for the project
- [] Created one or more pull requests in the GitHub repository for the project
- [] Discussed one or more pull requests in the GitHub repository for the project
- [] Made commits to a pull request that was ultimately merged to the main trunk
- [] Discussed one or more issues in the GitHub repository for the project
- [] Created one or more issues in the GitHub repository for the project
- [] Participated in the demonstration of a feature during a laboratory session
- [] Participated in the class discussions about project development
- [] Completed all of the documentation and reflection tasks in this document

### Learning Objectives

#### Explain one project task that you have undertaken and that illustrates the distinction between programming and software engineering

TODO: Please answer this question with at least two sentences.

#### Describe one software engineering task that you could not complete before taking the course but can successfully complete now

TODO: Please answer this question with at least two sentences.

#### Describe one software engineering task that you are still struggling to successfully complete but aim to successfully complete by the end of the academic semester

TODO: Please answer this question with at least two sentences.

#### Project Contributions

##### Issue Tracker

TODO: Please provide a list of the GitHub issues that you created:

TODO: Please provide a list of the GitHub issues for which you participated in the discussion:

TODO: Please provide a list of the GitHub issues for which you helped to resolve the problem:

##### Pull Requests

TODO: Please provide a list of the GitHub pull requests that you created:

TODO: Please provide a list of the GitHub pull requests for which you participated in the discussion:

TODO: Please provide a list of the GitHub pull requests for which you made a major contribution:

TODO: Please provide a list of your GitHub pull requests that were merged to the project's main trunk:

##### Project Commits

TODO: Please report the number of commits that you made to a pull request that
were ultimately merged to the main/master trunk branch of the project.
Importantly, you should only report the count of commits that were merged into
the main/master trunk branch of the project. This means that you cannot count
commits that were made to a branch for a pull request but not yet merged during
the week range for this specific project development assessment.

I make `X` commits to the main/master trunk branch of the long-term software project

##### Project Leadership

TODO: Please summarize the ways in which you served as a leader of the project.
Your response to this question should summarize your leadership role in at least
three sentences. If you do not think that you served in a leadership role then
you should summarize what role you played and then further explain why you did
not serve in a leadership role during the designated project development weeks.

##### Project Advice

TODO: Given you experiences with the project so far, what advice would you give
to the other students who are a member of your software engineering team? Your
response to this question should include at least two sentences.

## Project Implementation

### Feature Description

TODO: Using your own words, please provide a one to three sentence description
of a feature that you have added to the tool during this phase of the project.

### Command Execution and Output

TODO: Provide output in a fenced code block to illustrate how you would
demonstrate the aforementioned feature of the tool on your laptop. Your
response should also provide the command that you executed in an additional
fenced code block. Please label both code blocks.

- Fenced code block for the command that you executed

- Fenced code block for the output of the command that you executed

### Source Code Segment

TODO: Pick one example of a source code segment found in the long-term course project.
Your response to this question should furnish an input to a Python function, the
output of the Python function when provided with the input, and the source code
of the Python function itself. Your response to this question should also walk
through the lines of the source code in detail, demonstrating your understanding
of all the technical software engineering details that this source code was used
to explain. Your response to this question must contain a fenced code block with
the Python source code that you found in the project's GitHub repository.

TODO: Please do not pick the same source code example that you selected during
any prior reflection on your contributions to a long-term software project.
